# Pot-Hole-filling-robot
Introduction:
Potholes are one of the most common and significant issues faced by drivers worldwide, and their repair is essential for the safety of vehicles and pedestrians. Potholes are caused due to weather changes, constant vehicular traffic, and other environmental factors. Repairing potholes is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task, requiring a lot of manual effort. To address this issue, we have designed and developed a pothole filling robot that can assist the workers in repairing potholes without replacing their jobs.

Hardware Design:
The pothole filling robot is equipped with a Raspberry Pi 4B microprocessor, which controls the entire robot's functionality. It has two servo motors, one for opening and closing the gravel mix output, and the other for rotating the dispensing mechanism by 180 degrees. The Smartelex motor driver is used to control the robot's mobility, making it easy to navigate on various terrains.

The gravel mix is stored in a funnel-type storage unit, and a cup and PVC pipe are used to dispense the mix. The metal chassis and L clamps were handmade and welded, making the robot sturdy and durable.

Software Design:
The Raspberry Pi 4B microprocessor is programmed to control the robot's movements, gravel mix dispensing, and rotation of the dispensing mechanism. The robot is controlled using a laptop or computer over a Wi-Fi network, making it easy to operate and control.

Working:
The pothole filling robot is designed to assist workers in repairing potholes quickly and efficiently. The robot is operated by a worker who controls it using a laptop or computer over a Wi-Fi network. The worker drives the robot to the pothole, and the robot's mobility and sturdy design allow it to navigate on various terrains easily.

The worker uses the servo motor mechanism to open the gravel mix output and dispenses the mix using a cup and PVC pipe. The robot's dispensing mechanism can rotate 180 degrees, allowing the worker to fill potholes on both sides of the road without moving the robot. Once the pothole is filled, the worker closes the gravel mix output using the servo motor mechanism.

Conclusion:
The pothole filling robot designed and developed by our team is a collaborative robot that assists the workers in repairing potholes without replacing their jobs. The robot's sturdy design and mobility make it easy to navigate on various terrains, and the Raspberry Pi 4B microprocessor and Smartelex motor driver ensure smooth and efficient operation. The robot's funnel-type storage unit and dispensing mechanism make it easy to dispense the gravel mix, and the robot's dispensing mechanism's rotation allows workers to fill potholes on both sides of the road without moving the robot.
